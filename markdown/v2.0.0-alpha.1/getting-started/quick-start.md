# Quick start

Phonon builds are located in the `dist/` directory.
They provide convenient solutions that can be installed with no effort and that satisfy the most common editing use cases.

Please, read more about [custom builds](#0_getting-started/1_custom-build) if you would like to optimize the size of Phonon by importing required components only.

## Installation

The installation can take place in several ways:

- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/quark-dev/Phonon-Framework/releases) and use dist files.
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/quark-dev/Phonon-Framework.git`.
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com): `npm install phonon`.
- Install with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/): `yarn add phonon`.
- Install with [Bower](https://bower.io): `bower install phonon`.
